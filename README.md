# Benchmark for smartphone
My project proposes the development of a benchmark for mobile phones that will allow users to evaluate the performance of their devices objectively. This benchmark will be  designed to test three crucial aspects of a mobile phone's performance: power memory and graphics performance (GPU).

Programming language: Kotlin

Development environment: Android Studio
