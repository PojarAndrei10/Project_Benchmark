# Benchmark for smartphone
My project proposes the development of a benchmark for mobile phones, which allows users to evaluate the performance of their devices objectively. This benchmark will be designed to test three crucial aspects of a mobile phone's performance: the power of processing, memory and graphics performance (GPU).

Programming language: Kotlin

Development environment: Android Studio
